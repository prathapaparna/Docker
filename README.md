## Docker architecture

![image](https://github.com/prathapaparna/docker/assets/99127429/46f1f679-3343-4aac-be57-f590951952e7)

here are five major components in the Docker architecture:

a) Docker Daemon: listens to Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks and volumes.

b) Docker Clients: With the help of Docker Clients, users can interact with Docker. 
                   Docker client provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to run, 
				   and stop application commands to a Docker daemon.

c) Docker Host: provides a complete environment to execute and run applications. 
                It comprises of the Docker daemon, Images, Containers, Networks, and Storage.

d) Docker Registry: stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and 
                    Docker is configured to use images on Docker Hub by default. You can run your own registry on it.

e) Docker Images: are read-only templates that you build from a set of instructions written in Dockerfile. 
                 Images define both what you want your packaged application and its dependencies to look like what processes to run when itâ€™s launched.
